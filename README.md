# what is OPPs
Object-Oriented Programming, is a way of programming where you create "objects" and "class" that represent real-world things or concepts. These objects have "attributes" (properties) and "methods" (actions they can perform).
# Objects
objects are instance of a class.
# class
Class is a blue print of an object.Inside a class, we define variables, constants, member functions, and other functionality.
-> it is bundle of related data and functions.
# why use OPPs?
it helps organize code by grouping related data and behavior together, making it easier to manage and reuse.
# Fours principles of OOPs?
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
